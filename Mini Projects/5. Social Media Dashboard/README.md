### How to Customize

#### Changing Colors

You can easily customize the colors of the dashboard by modifying the CSS variables defined in the `style.css` file. Simply update the values of the variables under `:root` to achieve the desired color scheme.

#### Adding Social Media Accounts

To add or modify social media accounts, locate the respective sections in the HTML file (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube) and update the content with your own account details.

```html
<!-- facebook -->
<div class="card fb">
  <!-- ... -->
  <p>@yourusername</p>
  <!-- ... -->
  <h1>1987</h1>
  <!-- ... -->
  <p>Followers</p>
  <!-- ... -->
  <p>12 Today</p>
</div>
```

#### Customizing Fonts

I uses the "Inter" and "Montserrat" fonts. You can replace them with your preferred font choices by modifying the `font-family` property in the CSS.
